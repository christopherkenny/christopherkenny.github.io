By applying redistricting simulation and analysis\r\nmethods to DAS-protected 2010 Census data, we find that the protected\r\ndata are not of sufficient quality for redistricting purposes. We\r\ndemonstrate that the injected noise makes it impossible for states to\r\naccurately comply with the One Person, One Vote principle. Our analysis\r\nfinds that the DAS-protected data are biased against certain areas,\r\ndepending on voter turnout and partisan and racial composition, and that\r\nthese biases lead to large and unpredictable errors in the analysis of\r\npartisan and racial gerrymanders. Finally, we show that the DAS\r\nalgorithm does not universally protect respondent privacy. Based on the\r\nnames and addresses of registered voters, we are able to predict their\r\nrace as accurately using the DAS-protected data as when using the 2010\r\nCensus data. Despite this, the DAS-protected data can still inaccurately\r\nestimate the number of majority-minority districts. We conclude with\r\nrecommendations for how the Census Bureau should proceed with privacy\r\nprotection for the 2020 Census.\r\nThe Essential Role\r\nof Empirical Validation in Legislative Redistricting Simulation\r\n(with Benjamin Fifield, Kosuke Imai, and Jun Kawahara). 2020.\r\nStatistics and Public Policy.\r\n\r\nBibTeX\r\n@article{fife:etal:20,\r\n  author = {Benjamin Fifield and Kosuke Imai and Jun Kawahara and Christopher T.

These simulation methods are designed to yield a\r\nrepresentative sample of all redistricting plans that satisfy statutory\r\nguidelines and requirements such as contiguity, population parity, and\r\ncompactness. A proposed redistricting plan can be considered\r\ngerrymandered if it constitutes an outlier relative to this sample\r\naccording to partisan fairness metrics. Despite their growing use, an\r\ninsufficient effort has been made to empirically validate the accuracy\r\nof the simulation methods. We apply a recently developed computational\r\nmethod that can efficiently enumerate all possible redistricting plans\r\nand yield an independent sample from this population. We show that this\r\nalgorithm scales to a state with a couple of hundred geographical units.\r\nFinally, we empirically examine how existing simulation methods perform\r\non realistic validation datasets.\r\nWorking Papers\r\nIndividual and\r\nDifferential Harm in Redistricting\r\n(with Cory McCartan). Current version: 2022-06-24.\r\n\r\nBibTeX\r\n@misc{mcca:kenn:22,\r\n  doi = {10.31235/osf.io/nc2x7},\r\n  url = {https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nc2x7/},\r\n  author = {McCartan, Cory and Kenny, Christopher T.},\r\n  keywords = {representation, redistricting, voting rights, individual harm},\r\n  title = {Individual and Differential Harm in Redistricting},\r\n  publisher = {SocArXiv},\r\n  year = {2022}\r\n}\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nSocial scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing\r\npartisan bias in redistricting.But these measures cannot be easily\r\nadapted to other groups, including those defined by race, class, or\r\ngeography. Nor are they applicable to single- or no-party contexts such\r\nas local redistricting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\r\nunified framework of harm for evaluating the impacts of a districting\r\nplan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong. We\r\nconsider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under\r\nthe current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on\r\nexisting measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters\r\nand directly incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies\r\nfor estimating harm, and demonstrate the utility of our framework\r\nthrough analyses of partisan gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights\r\nlitigation in Alabama, and racial dynamics of Boston City Council\r\nelections.\r\nSimulated redistricting plans\r\nfor the analysis and evaluation of redistricting in the United States:\r\n50stateSimulations\r\n(with Cory McCartan, Tyler Simko, George Garcia III, Kevin Wang,\r\nMelissa Wu, Shiro Kuriwaki, and Kosuke Imai).

The\r\n50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted and other\r\ncongressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of\r\nredistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic\r\nresearch and court cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial\r\nefforts to combine multiple data sets, identify state-specific\r\nredistricting criteria, implement complex simulation algorithms, and\r\nsummarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete\r\nworkflow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based\r\nredistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all 50 states.\r\nThe resulting 50stateSimulations include ensembles of simulated 2020\r\ncongressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We\r\nalso provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for\r\ncustomized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available.\r\nThis article details the design, creation, and validation of the data.\r\nWidespread Partisan\r\nGerrymandering Mostly Cancels Nationally, but Reduces Electoral\r\nCompetition\r\n(with Cory McCartan, Tyler Simko, Shiro Kuriwaki, and Kosuke Imai).\r\nCurrent version 2022-08-15.\r\n\r\nBibTeX\r\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.06968,\r\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2208.06968},\r\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06968},\r\n  author = {Kenny, Christopher T. and McCartan, Cory and Simko, Tyler and Kuriwaki, Shiro and Imai, Kosuke},\r\n  keywords = {Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph), Applications (stat.AP), FOS: Physical sciences, FOS: Physical sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\r\n  title = {Widespread Partisan Gerrymandering Mostly Cancels Nationally, but Reduces Electoral Competition},\r\n  publisher = {arXiv},\r\n  year = {2022},\r\n  copyright = {arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nCongressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan\r\nactors, raising concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral\r\nimpact of gerrymandering from the effects of other factors including\r\ngeography and redistricting rules, we compare predicted election\r\noutcomes under the enacted plan with those under a large sample of\r\nnon-partisan, simulated alternative plans for all states. We find that\r\npartisan gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting cycle,\r\nbut most of the bias it creates cancels at the national level, giving\r\nRepublicans two additional seats, on average. In contrast, moderate\r\npro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting rules remains.\r\nFinally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral\r\ncompetition and makes the House’s partisan composition less responsive\r\nto shifts in the national vote.\r\nWorks-in-Progress\r\nInequality\r\nin Administrative Democracy: Large-Sample Evidence from American\r\nFinancial Regulation\r\n(with Daniel P.
