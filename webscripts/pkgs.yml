      description: Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified
        target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
        algorithms. The package allows for the implementation of various constraints
        in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population
        parity requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of various summary
        statistics and plotting functionality are also included. The package implements
        the SMC algorithm of McCartan and Imai (2023), the enumeration algorithm of
        Fifield, Imai, Kawahara, and Kenny (2020), the Flip MCMC algorithm of Fifield,
        Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2020), the Merge-split/Recombination algorithms of
        Carter et al. (2019) and DeFord et al. (2021), and the Short-burst optimization
        algorithm of Cannon et al. (2020).
