    color: '#A61C00'
    description: Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified
      target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
      algorithms. The package allows for the implementation of various constraints
      in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity
      requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of various summary statistics
      and plotting functionality are also included. The package implements the SMC
      algorithm of McCartan and Imai (2023), the enumeration algorithm of Fifield,
      Imai, Kawahara, and Kenny (2020), the Flip MCMC algorithm of Fifield, Higgins,
      Imai and Tarr (2020), the Merge-split/Recombination algorithms of Carter et
      al. (2019) and DeFord et al. (2021), and the Short-burst optimization algorithm
      of Cannon et al. (2020).

      some statistics take a while to compute. This package offers a way to keep notes
      on statistics, simple functions, and small objects. Notepads can be locked to
      avoid accidental updates. Notepads keep track of who added the notes and when
      the notes were added. A simple text representation is used to allow for clear
      version histories.
