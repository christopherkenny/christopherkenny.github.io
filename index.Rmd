I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government, studying American Politics and Political Methodology. I am currently serving as a pre-doc at the Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School. My substantive focus is on redistricting and gerrymandering. I work on open source R tools for analyzing redistricting and voting rights in context. I am affiliated with the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University, the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University, and the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project.
