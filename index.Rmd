Hi! This website is in progress. I am shifting from OpenScholar to have more control over the html elements of this site. Please take a look at [https://www.christophertkenny.com](https://www.christophertkenny.com) for now!

About me:
I am a rising G3 in Government at Harvard University. As I close in on dissertation specifics, I am largely using this summer to write R packages that I expect to use for topics related to my dissertation. This relies mostly on Census data and metrics relevant for electoral system fairness and reform. I am especially interested in (and consequently focused on) redistricting in the US. Redistricting functions as a short term, but highly influential, method of reform. After all, democracy is a carefully designed data collection method.
