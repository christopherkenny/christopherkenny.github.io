# About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Princeton Data-Driven Social Science](https://ddss.princeton.edu/).
I received my PhD in Government from Harvard University in 2025.
I received a B.A. in Mathematics and Government from Cornell University in 2019 and an M.A. in Government from Harvard University in 2021.

My research focuses on American politics and political methodology, with a specialization in redistricting. 
I am a founding member and Co-PI of the [Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project](https://alarm-redist.github.io/). 
I am affiliated with the [Center for American Political Studies](https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University and the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/). 
In 2022, I was a fellow at the [Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School](https://www.hlselectionlaw.org/).

My research focuses on primarily on American democratic institutions, with a particular emphasis on redistricting. 
My prior work has examined the net effect of gerrymandering in the US House in the 2020 cycle ([*PNAS 2023*](research.html#widespread-partisan-gerrymandering-mostly-cancels-nationally-but-reduces-electoral-competition)).
With the ALARM Project, I've contributed to the creation of simulated redistricting plans for all congressional redistricting plans in the 2020 cycle ([*Nature: Scientific Data 2022*](research.html#simulated-redistricting-plans-for-the-analysis-and-evaluation-of-redistricting-in-the-united-states)) with ongoing work to extend this to the 2010 cycle.
My research further includes a working paper with Cory McCartan, ["Individual and Differential Harm in Redistricting"](research.html#individual-and-differential-harm-in-redistricting), which proposes an individual approach to fairness in redistricting.
In a working paper with the ALARM Project, ["Redistricting Reforms Reduce Gerrymandering by Constraining Partisan Actors"](research.html#redistricting-reforms-reduce-gerrymandering-by-constraining-partisan-actors), we demonstrate that restrictive reforms improve partisan fairness of redistricting plans.
In a related working paper with the ALARM Project, ["Gerrymandering and geographic polarization have reduced electoral competition"](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.15885), we show that reductions in competitiveness across time are driven more by geographic polarization than by gerrymandering.

My work on census data relates to how the construction and privacy protection of census data impacts end users.
My work with Jake Brown and Tyler Simko demonstrates that estimates of racial segregation using Census tracts are robust to the modifiable areal unit problem (["Any Way You Slice It"](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nv5up_v2)).
My work on census data privacy includes a policy evaluation paper which details the negative impact of differential privacy in the 2020 Census on redistricting and voting rights enforcement ([*Science Advances 2021*](research.html#the-use-of-differential-privacy-for-census-data-and-its-impact-on-redistricting-the-case-of-the-2020-u.s.-census)). 
It further characterizes how certain communities, including Hispanic and multi-racial populations, are disproportionately impacted by the privacy noise in the 2020 Census ([*Science Advances 2024*](research.html#evaluating-bias-and-noise-induced-by-the-u.s.-census-bureaus-privacy-protection-methods)).

To support my own research and the research of others, I have developed over two dozen R packages, including [`redist`](https://alarm-redist.org/redist/), [`geomander`](https://christophertkenny.com/geomander/), and [`censable`](https://christophertkenny.com/censable/). 
In 2024, my packages were downloaded over 100,000 times from CRAN. 
For more information on the full suite of packages that I've developed, see my [software page](software.html).
