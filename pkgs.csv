The package allows for the implementation of various constraints in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of various summary statistics and plotting functionality are also included. The package implements the SMC algorithm of McCartan and Imai (2023), the enumeration algorithm of Fifield, Imai, Kawahara, and Kenny (2020), the Flip MCMC algorithm of Fifield, Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2020), the Merge-split/Recombination algorithms of Carter et al.
