This post walks through how I set up a simple bot in Bluesky Social.
The bot, [@cranupdates.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/cranupdates.bsky.social), posts every 4 hours with details about packages that have been updated, added, or removed from CRAN.
Everything is run in R, primarily using the [bskyr](https://christophertkenny.com/bskyr/) package.
It's run for free on GitHub Actions and data is stored between runs using Google Sheets.

The basic mechanics of the bot are:

- fetch currently available packages with `available.packages()`
- load the last run's data from Google Sheets
- compare the two and identify changes
- make posts with `bs_post()` for new packages, updated packages, and removed packages
- save the current data to Google Sheets

This bot is entirely schedule based, so it doesn't need to interact with other Bluesky users.
Below, I detail how I set up the bot, including how to authenticate with Google Sheets (using [`googlesheets4`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/)) and GitHub Actions.


# Setting up the bot

To set up the bot, we first need a public GitHub repo.^[You could use something more private, but for a generic bot, public means GitHub Actions is free and can get the job done.]
For my CRAN Update bot, I placed it in [`christopherkenny/bskyr-cran-bot`](https://github.com/christopherkenny/bskyr-cran-bot).


- Create a script that does the work

## Scheduling the run

To schedule the run, we need to tell it a few things:

- when to run it
- what to run
  - what environment variables it needs
  - what R version to use
  - what R packages to install
  - what script to run
  
Below, I explain these steps. But first, the completed workflow looks like:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: main
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1,5,9,13,17,21 * * *'

name: Post

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      BLUESKY_APP_USER: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_APP_USER }}
      BLUESKY_APP_PASS: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_APP_PASS }}
      GARGLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.GARGLE_KEY }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: 'release'

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
        with:
          packages:
            any::here
            any::dplyr
            any::stringr
            any::googlesheets4
            any::bskyr

      - run: Rscript 'post.R'
```

This whole file lives in `.github/workflows/post.yml` in the [repo](https://github.com/christopherkenny/bskyr-cran-bot/blob/main/.github/workflows/post.yml).

First, let's break down the when part:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: main
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1,5,9,13,17,21 * * *'

```

This tells GitHub Actions to run the workflow when there's a push to the `main` branch.
It also says to schedule the workflow to run every 4 hours.
CRON entries are `minute hour day month weekday`, so `0 1,5,9,13,17,21 * * *` means to run at 1am, 5am, 9am, 1pm, 5pm, and 9pm every day.
As implied, setting the star says to run it every day, every month, and every weekday.
More documentation for the `schedule` part can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule).

Then we give the job a name, "Post", with `name: Post`.

The next section simply indicates we want the job to run on the latest version of Ubuntu:

```yaml
jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
Next, we provide environment variables, that we set in the repo settings. 
See {#sec-auth} for an explanation of the `env` variables.

```yaml
    env:
      BLUESKY_APP_USER: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_APP_USER }}
      BLUESKY_APP_PASS: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_APP_PASS }}
      GARGLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.GARGLE_KEY }}
```

Now, we can give it the steps to use. 


First, it needs to download the contents of the repo, so that it can access our `post.R` script.


```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

Then, we have to let it know to install R. 
We can use one of the [`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) actions, [`setup-r@v2`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r).
I'm using the released R version (4.3.2) at the time of writing this.
You could pin a specific version, but for bots, I plan to do the minor maintenance necessary as R versions increment.

```yaml
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: 'release'
```

And then we list the packages we need. 
This uses the [`setup-r-dependencies@v2`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r-dependencies) action, again from [`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
Below, I make use of the  prefixes: `any::` and `github::`.
`any::` is used for packages on CRAN, generally, but will also run if you've installed it elsewhere through a prior dependency.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="false"}

## Using GitHub Packages

You can use `github::` in place of `any::` for packages on GitHub. 
You just need to specify the user and repo.
So, if you want to use the dev version of a package, like `bskyr`, you could use the syntax:
`github::christopherkenny/bskyr`.

:::


```yaml
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
        with:
          packages:
            any::here
            any::dplyr
            any::stringr
            any::googlesheets4
            any::bskyr

```
If you already use `renv`, you could instead use that with the [`setup-renv`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-renv) action.

Finally, we tell it to run `post.R` with:
```yaml
      - run: Rscript 'post.R'
```


# Authenticating with Google for GitHub Actions {#sec-auth}

	- Service account (link for details)
	- Share sheet with service account
	- x <- gargle::secret_make_key(); Sys.setenv(GARGLE_KEY = x)
	- Add to gh actions
	- run secret_encrypt_json('path/to/downloaded/key.json', 'where/to/save/it.json', key = 'GARGLE_KEY')
	- update the workflow. see https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/managing-tokens-securely.html#ci-configuration
